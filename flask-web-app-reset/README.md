# Troubleshooting Flask App in Docker

## Issue: 404 Errors for Routes

Encountered 404 errors for the `/` and `/about` routes, even though the Flask application was running inside the Docker container.

## Troubleshooting Steps:

1.  **Verified Code:** Verified that `app/__init__.py` and `app/routes.py` had the correct imports and route definitions.
2.  **Verified Templates:** 
Confirmed that `index.html` and `about.html` templates were present.
3.  **Complete Reset:** Created a new directory (`flask-web-app-reset/`) and copied the project files to rule out any environment-specific issues.
4.  **Different Base Image:** Now testing to see if changing the base Python image in the Dockerfile to `python:3.9-slim-buster` resolves the issue.

## Current Status:

* The `flask-web-app-reset/` directory contains a copy of the project files in a clean environment for testing.
* Currently testing the `python:3.9-slim-buster` base image in the `flask-web-app-reset/Dockerfile`.
* [Add any results from testing here]
